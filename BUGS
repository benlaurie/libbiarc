BUG list

experimental/thickness : for a circle it seems to converge to the
correct value however only if we crank up the number of node.

main viewer prog : whenever we resample with more points than the
original, then we need more DiffuseColor values!!!! otherwise
we get an out of bounds error.

resample doesn't work properly, something with the STRAIGHT LENGTH

Tube.cpp : the mesh generation routinge using the frenet framing
in the closed curve case doesn't work!!!

the viewers in inventor/ do not like straight lines!!!
e.g. if you try to look at the line.pkf in the objects/ dir,
it complains about zero length vectors.

resampling,resegmenting a curve while semi-transparent messes up
the mesh in the viewer progs in dir inventor/!!!!

merge_all texture map goes away when cycling once through the
          different viewing modes ...
