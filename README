tangentOnBiarc(); fixed
needs to be checked in the cvs

templatizing started. include, lib, objects,
tools, inventor directories are ok.
only the Makefile for the pkf generation of the objects
crashes, dunno why

the whole thing is still under heavy construction

do not build all ... !!!

for the stokes meshing prog just type

make stokes

the Biarc Library part documentation is ok for
Matrix3
Vector3
Biarc
Tube
Curve
-------------------------

Remaining docs :

tools direc
object direc  -> started some doc but not at all finished
inventor direc
temp dir
